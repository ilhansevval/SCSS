### *Turned to Pico CSS Clone Project to SCSS:*

[Pico SCSS Clone Project](https://pico-scss-clone.netlify.app/)

For working on with the SCSS, you need to install **Live Sass Compiler** extension to Vscode.

```"liveSassCompile.settings.formats": [
        // You can add more
        {
            // "format": "compressed",
            // "extensionName": ".min.css",
    
            // / -> denotes relative to the workspace root
            "savePath": "/css"
        },
    ]`

And you need to some configurations in the settings.json file as i mentioned above.

If you want to do more complex configurations, you can take a look at the documentation.
